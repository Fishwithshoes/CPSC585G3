WELCOME TO THUNDERBOWL!

Thunderbowl is a simple, arena based car combat game. The goal of the game is to accrue as many points as possible by destroying
as many opponents as possible within the time limit. Games can involve 1, 2, 3 or 4 players battling it out in the thunderbowl.
Gather ammunition for you machine gun, flame thrower and rocket launcher from powerups around the map. Use the missle launcher
sparingly, as the only source of missle ammo lies above the central pit. Keep playing for a one in ten chance to battle under the
blood moon, when the thunderbowl fills with blood and the cars take on a more sinister light.Be careful of the enemy players, they 
carry the same weapons you do! Try to approach from behind and always keep your speed up! Good Luck!
